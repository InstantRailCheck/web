# InstantRailCheck

## Mission

Build the most trusted crowdsourced database of real-world bank transfer compatibility.

## MVP Scope

InstantRailCheck answers one core question:

Can Bank A send money instantly to Bank B?

## Version 1 Features (v1.0.0 — shipped June 28 2026)

**Route search**
- Select any two banks (sender + receiver) via searchable combobox
- Rails categorized as Primary (RTP, FedNow) or Fallback (ACH, Wire, Zelle, Other, Unknown)
- Per-rail stats: success rate, average settlement time, direction (Push / Pull / Both), last tested date
- Stale warning shown when last report is older than 180 days
- Confidence level: HIGH (>50 reports), MEDIUM (>10), LOW otherwise
- Shows "no data yet" state for unknown routes

**Submit route report**
- Requires a signed-in account
- Fields: from bank, to bank, rail used, direction, status (success / failed / delayed), date tested, settlement time (optional), notes (optional)
- Users can add a bank inline if it doesn't exist yet
- Reports attributed to user account

**Accounts**
- Magic link + 8-digit OTP via email — no password required
- Session expires when browser is closed

## Version 1.1 Features (v1.1.0 — shipped July 8 2026)

**Bank profile pages**
- `/banks/[id]` shows sending/receiving rail stats, plus website, address, and phone
- `/banks` directory with name search and FedNow/RTP filters

**Official-source data enrichment**
- Banks: website + address from FDIC BankFind
- Credit unions: website + address + phone from NCUA's quarterly call report data (no live API exists; synced via `scripts/sync-ncua-directory.mjs`)
- Brokerages: address + phone from FINRA BrokerCheck (no official website field exists for broker-dealers in any regulatory source checked)
- Never guesses — a missing field beats a wrong one. Matching favors institution size/activity status to avoid mismatching common names

**Payment rail explorer**
- FedNow and RTP participation checked against the Fed's and The Clearing House's official participant lists when a bank is added
- `/rails` browses confirmed participants; badges shown on profile pages

**Compare, timing, and history**
- `/compare` — two banks side by side
- `/timing` — settlement time leaderboard by rail (min. 2 reports per bank+rail)
- `/changelog` — recent banks added and reports submitted, with a "first confirmed" badge

**Public API**
- `/api/banks`, `/api/banks/:id`, `/api/routes`, `/api/changelog` — read-only, CORS-enabled, documented at `/developers`
- Rate limited to 60 requests/minute per IP via an atomic Postgres counter; self-cleaning via `pg_cron`

**Security**
- `route_reports` inserts restricted to authenticated users, enforced to their own `user_id` (previously any anonymous client could insert and spoof `user_id`)
- RLS audited across all tables; no client-writable access to reference tables

## Version 1.2 Features (v1.2.0 — shipped July 8 2026)

**Zelle verification**
- No official API exists; Zelle's own "search" page turned out to be an unfiltered paginated directory of ~2,489 partner institutions, scraped via `scripts/sync-zelle-participants.mjs`
- Known limitation, disclosed in-app: Zelle's own directory is incomplete (confirmed — SoFi genuinely supports Zelle but isn't listed), so a missing badge doesn't mean a bank lacks support the way it does for FedNow/RTP
- Automated enrichment now never downgrades an already-`true` rail flag back to `false`, so a manual correction (like SoFi's) survives future re-syncs

**Visa Direct and Mastercard Send**
- No scrapable directory exists — both check capability per-card via BIN lookup APIs gated behind production partnership access (sandbox tiers only return synthetic test data)
- Added as self-reportable rail types instead, same as every rail before official verification existed
- Shown on `/rails` in a separate "Community-reported" section, clearly distinguished from the three officially-verified columns (min. 2 successful reports to appear)

## Data Principles

- Real-world reports only
- No guessing
- Unknown is better than wrong
- Show test dates clearly
- Stale data should be marked stale

## Seed Routes

- Chase to Gesa Credit Union: RTP confirmed
- Chase to SoFi: ACH observed
- Chase to Fidelity CMA: ACH observed
- Chase to Schwab: ACH observed
- Chase to BECU: ACH observed

## Build Rules

- Small commits
- Test before pushing
- Keep MVP focused
- No feature creep
